### C Sharp Compillations
#### MPOP Reverse II (Ryann Kim Sesgundo)
---
> This is just the remake version of my compillation of C Sharp, with mix of Object Oriented Programming. In this project, the main class or main file is the `Program.cs` where you can find the `Main` function. It has the consoles where the program used, also its classes. I use the method of `namespace` and the `using` to get all the same data here. This is to easily recognize, whether the program is just basic or fundamentals, or in OOP form.

### How to start
**PC**
> First you need to download the `.Net` SDK that you may found [here](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/thank-you/sdk-7.0.200-windows-x64-installer). And then, you also need [VS Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/Download) for you to easily code. Next is to download the extension of `C#` in VS Studio Code.

**Android**
> I highly recommend to you to use [Replit](https://replit.com) to run these program. It is for you to code without any hastle. First is go to [Replit](https://replit.com) and create an account, if you already have an account, create a program or a repository, bu clicking the `Create +` button. Click template, and search for `C#`, not **Mono C#** only **C#**. Next is name your repo, and click `+ Create Repl`.

> Theses is just a simple program, and I'm still newbie in learning C#, that's why I want to share it with you.
